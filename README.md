# Ein-Würfel-System for Foundry VTT (ews4fvtt)
Implementation of the rules for the "Ein-Würfel-System" (One-Dice-System) - abbreviated as EWS - as a module on FoundryVTT.
EWS is a generic roleplaying system with a strong focus acting instead of rolling dices. By integrating this game in Foundry, I try to even further verbalize the rules and hide any dice rolling behind textual descriptions. All values should be represented as text.
The original rules can be found (in german only) on 1w6.org.

This is still an early beta and not useable at all. Come back again, when version reaches 1.0.0 or contact me if you want to support development.
